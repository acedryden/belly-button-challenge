Belly Button Challenge 
The purpose of this challenge is to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 
The dataset was read via D3 in javascript, and using plotly a bar chart, bubble chart and table with demographic information is displayed. 
The dashboard is an interactive dashboard with a dropdown menu where an user can select a sample ID of a participant. The dashboard will then update all visualizations to show that specific participant's demographic information, a bar chart displaying the top OTUs present in their results, and a bubble chart showing all OTU values, sized by the values of OTUs in that participant. 
Tools used: Javascript including D3 & Plotly, HTML
